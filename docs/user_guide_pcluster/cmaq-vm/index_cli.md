# Use CLI to Create Single VM 

If you are not able to use the AWS Web Console, an alternate way to create a Single VM is using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

Creating an EC2 instance from the Command Line is easy to do. In this tutorial we will give examples on how to create an ec2-instance that uses a public AMI that contains the sofware and benchmark data pre-loaded.


Create a single Virtual Machine (VM) using an ami with software pre-loaded using either a c6a.2xlarge, c6a.8xlarge or c6a.48xlarge instance with gp3 filesystem.
