# Use CLI to Create Single VM 

CMAQv5.4 software pre-installed

Creating an EC2 instance from the Command Line is easy to do. In this tutorial we will give examples on how to create an ec2-instance that uses a public AMI that contains the sofware and benchmark data pre-loaded.


Create a single Virtual Machine (VM) using an ami with software pre-loaded using either a c6a.2xlarge, c6a.8xlarge or c6a.48xlarge instance with gp3 filesystem.
