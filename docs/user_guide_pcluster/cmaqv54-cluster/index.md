# CMAQv5.4 Parallel Cluster Advanced (optional)

* Learn how to create the ParallelCluster using c6a.large head node and c6a.48xlarge as the compute nodes.
* Learn how to install CMAQ software and underlying libraries, copy input data, and run CMAQ.
```{admonition} Notice
:class: warning

Skip this tutorial if you successfully completed the CMAQv5.4 Intermediate Tutorial and wish to proceed to the post-processing and QA instructions.
Note, you may wish to build the underlying libraries and CMAQ and code if you wish to create a ParallelCluster using a different family of compute nodes, such as the c6gn.16xlarge compute nodes AMD Graviton.
