# List of ideas for future work

1. Create MVP yaml and software install scripts for intel compiler
2. Benchmark 2 day case using intel compiler version of CMAQ and compare to GCC timings
3. Repeat Benchmark Runs using c6gn.16xlarge compute nodes with 64vcpu or 32 cpu per node with hyperthreading turned off.
