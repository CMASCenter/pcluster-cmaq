These scripts were obtained from the following tutorial.
Note, it is configured to use AWS CL2, using config file to create the parallel cluster.
Also, it uses a yml file to create the cloud formation stack.

I also need to figure out how to specify csh as the default shell for the post_install.csh script so that we can also modify this to install all of the CMAQ software stack.
